The Trustlines App is the first mobile app to leverage the Trustlines protocol for efficient peer-to-peer payments. 

The app is build with React-Native and we are publishing an [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/trustlines-app/id1541175356) 
and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=network.trustlines.mobileapp) version.

You can download the Trustlines binaries by following the links on the [trustlines.app](https://trustlines.app) website.

As you might know the Trustlines Protocol is an Open-Source stack of software. In the spirit of it we plan to open-source 
the Trustlines app. Until we do this if you want to build on top of the Trustlines app you may request early access to the 
source-code by sending us an [e-mail request](mailto:contact@trustlines.app?subject=Early-Access). 

:::info
The rest of the documentation assumes that you have access to the source code of the app. If you don't, but want to build
on top of the Trusltines App [contact us](mailto:contact@trustlines.app?subject=Early-Access).
